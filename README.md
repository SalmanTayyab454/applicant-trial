# Applicant Trail

## Frontend 
This is a simple React app where I have just designed a login screen with some backend functionality.

### Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository and run npm install to install all the dependencies. You can then start the development server by running npm start.
npm install
npm start
This will start the app in development mode on http://localhost:3001. You should see the app running in the browser.

### Features:
Currently no feature is integrated in this app.

## Improvements:
- Add the backend functionality to make it more functional
